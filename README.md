# Crowdfund Page

## Description
A crowdfunding landing page for a series of ergonomic computer stands. Created for a [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io) challenge where the assets are provided but you are allowed to implement the design in any way you wish. For this challenge I chose the technologies listed below. The file structure is inspired by [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) but it does not implement every possible level due to size.

## Technologies 
- React
- CSS Modules
- HTML

## Installation

Enter your project directory

`cd project-directory`

Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:anthonybui94/crowdfund-page.git`

Move into the created directory

`cd crowdfund-page`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Usage
The user can see hover states for interactive elements, make a selection of which pledge to make, see an updated progress bar after confirming a pledge, and toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked.
